# Laravel + Vue.js: Example AdminPanel

This is a demo-project, fully generated by [QuickAdminPanel.com](https://quickadminpanel.com) without writing a single line of code.

In addition to roles/permissions manager, there are a few example CRUDs (Contact Management and Transactions)

For the design, we're using [Material Dashboard theme](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard) from Creative Tim.

## How to use

- Clone the repository with __git clone__
- Copy __.env.example__ file to __.env__ and edit database credentials there
- Also add to __.env__ file the variable __SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=myproject.test__ - change "myproject.test" to your domain. __IMPORTANT__: domain should be with port but without https/https prefix. For example, "127.0.0.1:8000" is valid, but "http://project.test" is not valid.
- Run __composer install__
- Run __php artisan key:generate__
- Run __php artisan migrate --seed__ (it has some seeded data for your testing)
- Run __npm install__ 
- Run __npm run dev__ 
- That's it: launch the main URL.
